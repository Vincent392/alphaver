## Description

"The video has been recovered from an archived thread of an invite-only gaming forum. This security gap has not been an issue before, nor after its discovery, as the original forum post detailing it has been taken down swiftly and didn't recieve much spread. We were not aware that the video was archived, but it never grew to be a major problem, at least from what i've seen"

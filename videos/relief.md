## Description
_none_

## Anomalies
This video contains several pieces of a QR code, that when assembled, leads to a MEGA link, containing a .zip with the R4 client and server jars, and a folder named datablocks, containing 11 encrypted .xk files, and dec.exe, which is the decoder for these files. (_these will be analyzed soon, however we do not have the code for 2 of the blocks, and the ones that **are** decoded have non-canon/joke content._)

**RUN THESE FILES AT YOUR OWN RISK, THEY _MIGHT_ BE MALICIOUS!**

(0:20) We see in-game that the username is MachineRage2046, and one of the captions reads "Hello again. 6 here." _This seems to confirm that [MachineRage](/lore/other-characters.md) is [dev6](/lore/developers.md)._

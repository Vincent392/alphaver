## Description
One of us found a .jar file of the old version

## Characters

  Persumeably the person recording and typing
* ORBL
  * ORBL found the version on their computer, according to Discord message history.
* MachineRage
  * MachineRage responds right after [the game crashes](#crash)
  * It is implied that he is a developer of these versions:
    > **MachineRage:** yeah, there were these things that happened when the PC was connected to **our** servers, they shouldn't have appened now

## Anomalies
* 01:27:37: An iron door in distance causes a lag spike

* 03:34:34: Third door, which is followed by [a crash](#crash)
* 03:59:27: A **74 frame** long blackout

## Crash
At **03:34:34**, a crash occurs and the game crashes.
Before it closes though, an error message is displayed, which says:
> Unable to connect to main servers.  
> Please make sure you are connected to the internet

Then the game closes.

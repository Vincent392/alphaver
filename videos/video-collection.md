"I Don't Know When I First Found The Version Haha..."

"do you have anything else archived or is it only this jar?"

"I Have The Launcher"

"There Are HTMLCache Files"

(attachment)

"that's still pretty good"

"i don't think we have this yet"

"[6] do you have anything on this?"


"I don't actually have the launcher's source, let me see"

"That's a huge find actually"

"oh my god [6] look at this jar"

"Isn't this just R4?"

"Wait the size is weird"

"What the hell is 18#"

"I Used Trick From The Video To Get Unban I Remember.... after That I Had 18# Too"

## Characters
Several seemingly unknown players, one of which impersonates dev2 in Video 6.

## Events

### Video 1

The player shows off a bug in R4's Freerun gamemode where exiting the intended play area crashes the game and deletes all of the users worlds.

### Video 2
The player shows how to access a secret world hidden in the Lilypad version of the game.

To trigger it, you must enter each world slot in the order 4, 1, 5, 3, 1, then enter World 2.

The player then explores then secret world.

_will add analysis of this world soon, promise! :)_

### Video 3
The player demonstrates a "creepy glitch" they found in the Unrestricted Preview 2 version of the game.

The player puts all their things in a chest, exepct for a pickaxe.

They then say that you need to build stairs above water to the build limit, then wait for nightfall and set your render distance to the lowest setting.

The player walks up the stairs, and jumps into the water.

The game loads into a new level, made of reddish bedrock. _The screen also appears to be tinted red._

The player mines two obsidian in front of them, then says that if you right click the sign, it disappears.

The player then walks into the lava and kills themselves.

### Video 4
**Watch at your own discretion. This video is quite disturbing.**

The video begins in the players house, with them telling us they want to show us their house they made in Minecraft.

They walk outside to find several upside-down Ts placed in their world. _;)_

After freaking out, they walk around to their backyard, where they then find a Herobrine shrine built. They then freak out again, which is understandable considering how horiffic these events are.

_On a serious note, this video appears to be a joke/troll by the gamerunners. (_duh_)_

### Video 5
The player walks around their world and finds an iron door, which they use to enter The Hub.

After walking around for a while, they find a hallway that aruptly ends, leading to the outside of The Hub.

The render distance drops for a moment, and when it goes back to normal, the sky texture has changed.

This outside area consists of a sea of DBG blocks, with lots of shadow players moving erracticly, that are named "Recruitment client accesses illegal location - may cause bugs".

The player walks around a little longer, then the video ends.

### Video 6
The player is demonstating how to play Minecraft offline.

They open a launcher file in a hex editor, and change four bytes to "00 00 00 02", as well as five bytes towards the bottom to "64 47 56 7A 64"

They then save the file, and open the launcher again.

There is a text box in the bottom right corner of the launcher that says "logged in as dev2". This appears to be how dev2 was impersonated, as mentioned in the description of [Sunrise](/videos/sunrise.md).

_Among other things, the changelog mentions that the team wanted the game to rely heavily on online play, but the original Minecraft team didn't, so it appears that is why they forked the development._

The player launches the game, and walks around some.

### Video 7
The player shows us his cool Minecraft house, and how to build one ourselves.

The player then trolls us. _:)_

The video then cuts to a phone _(?)_ camera, looking at a computer screen, which shows the perspective of a recruitment _(?)_ player, which has been watching the two players.

## Notes
It's worthy of mentioning that in Video 6, the person recording has several lost media items, the ones I could idenify are:

**
JoJo's Bizzare Adventure: Phantom Blood, a movie that only showed once in Japan

Copeland's now-found Herobrine Minecraft stream

Mario 128, a dropped sequel to Mario 64

Sonic X-Treme, an unreleased Sega game

Some sort of N64 Disc Drive(?) game
